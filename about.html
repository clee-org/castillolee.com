            Hey, you may know me as Andre too. I'm currently a junior level Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student at Glendale Community college and is about to transfer. I'm also the President
            and Founder of Vaqueros Esports! You can usually find me in the learning center where I also tutor students in                 mathematics from high school algebra to differential equations and in writing!
        </p>

            I'm a senior at Bishop Michael Eldon School in the Bahamas looking to study computer science in college! I like to play video games
            in my free time and I also play with my dog, cookie!
