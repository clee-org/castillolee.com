        Chicken Thigh BBQ Marinate (Pan seared)
        </h4>
        <p>
    </br>
        3-4 cloves garlic </br>
        6 grinds of black pepper </br>
        3 TbSp soy sauce datu puti </br>
        1 TbSp vinegar </br>
        1 TeaSp salt </br>
        1 Half cup water </br>
        3 TbSp sugar </br>
        3 TbSp kalamansi </br>
</p>
        <p>
    General Instructions:</br><br>

    Its best to do this in a stainless steel pot in my experience. Heat pot to medium-high (searing heat) and place Chicken
    skin into pot and sear the skin. It will bring the chicken oil out and rend the fat. Use this to cook the chicken
    I leave the pot lid on to have it broil and cook more evenly. Don't forget to lower the heat after the fats are gone!

        Crust:<br>
        Honey Maid crackers x2 packs<br>
        Sugar<br>
        Unsalted butter<br><br>

        Filling<br>

        1 serving of flavored or greek yogurt<br>

        1 tablespoon of vanilla extract<br><br>

        General Instructions:<br><br>
        Make sure you let all the refrigerated ingredients hit room temperature before starting. It helps with mixing. For the crust, mix sugar first<br>
        and then drizzle melted butter whilst mixing so as to prevent clumping. Preheat oven to 375F and make sure to prepare a boiling water bath<br>
        before putting the mold inside.
