            Hey, you may know me as Andre too. I'm currently a junior level Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student at Glendale Community college and is about to transfer. I'm also the President
            and Founder of Vaqueros Esports! You can usually find me in the learning center where I also tutor students in mathematics from high school algebra to differential equations and in writing!
            <hr>
            All works and projects on this page are owned by me.
