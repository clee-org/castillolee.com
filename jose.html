            Hey, I'm Jose, some of my friends also know me as Andre. I'm currently a junior level Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student at Glendale Community college 
            and is about to transfer. I'm also the President for the Esports and International Students clubs as well as the Founder for the Esports athletics teams on campus.
            You can usually find me in the learning center at Glendale College where I also tutor students in mathematics from high school algebra to differential equations and in writing!
            Some of my hobbies are in sports like Rugby and Archery, playing the piano, and trying new restaurants. I used to play for Freeport RFC, and right now I shoot at and
            am a member of the Pasadena Roving Archers where I also volunteer. I also play badminton and tennis if you are looking for someone to hit the courts with!
            <br><br><br><br>
            Below, I've attached my most up to date resume.
