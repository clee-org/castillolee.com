           Hello everyone, my name is Shannen Castillo Lee, or just Shan for short. Currently, I attend Bishop Michael Eldon School in the Bahamas as a high school senior. I hope to major in Computer Science in the near future. I love to play video games, sing draw, paint, and play musical instruments!
